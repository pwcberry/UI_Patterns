UI Patterns in Code
===================

This project began as a method of study for understanding User Interface Design Patterns.

The Design Patterns presented here are derived from _Designing Interfaces, 2nd Edition_, by Jennifer Tidwell. This book was a recommended text for my course.

As a front-end engineer, and always excited by problems involving user interfaces and code, I decided to utilise my web development skills to understand better how to implement design patterns for the web.


The future
----------

Quite possibly this can be expanded beyond HTML/CSS/JavaScript. I have decided to keep this first phase all about vanilla web development, and in particular, utilising only the latest versions of these languages.

Maybe this be expanded to accommodate other user interface environments such as Cocoa, Android or XAML?
