Problem Statement
=================

Many developers or designers who do not have experience coding for the user interface are unaware of how user interface design patterns can be coded using web standards. 
This leads to poor implementation of visual designs and unexpected behaviour for users, thereby more time is spent reworking the code.

Vision Statement
================

"UI Patterns in Code" will give coders confidence in understanding how design patterns accommodate interactive behaviours and to write code effectively so the application behaves as expected by the user, and as envisioned by the designer.
