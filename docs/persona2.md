<p class="tag-line">I love bringing designs to life on the web.</p>

Thomas graduated from RMIT Design School and has persued a number of jobs in his career, starting with print design for a greeting card company. 

In the late 90s, he became interested in the web, and the hive of activity that was being generated, and moved into the nascent field of web design. Occasionally he may engage in work for print, but his enthusiasm for the web overshadows this other work.

His current role in a digital agency includes preparing user interface designs for the development team. He has dabbled in HTML, but would really like to help developers who are not UI-savvy to ensure his designs are brought to life as he intended.
