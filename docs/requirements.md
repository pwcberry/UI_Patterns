Requirements Definition
=======================

Problem Statement
-----------------

Many developers or designers who do not have experience coding for the user interface are unaware of how user interface design patterns can be coded using web standards. This leads to poor implementation of visual designs and unexpected behaviour for users, thereby more time is spent reworking the code.

Vision Statement
----------------

"UI Patterns in Code" will give coders confidence in understanding how design patterns accommodate interactive behaviours and to write code effectively so the application behaves as expected by the user, and as envisioned by the designer.

Persona Expectations
--------------------

Victoria is a busy person, and relies on Google to provide answers to her coding problems. A web site that provides her with solutions for typical coding problems relating to user interface - specifically web pages - needs to be well organized, easily searchable, and contain concise code based on standards. 

Thomas is hands-on, and keeps his tools neatly arranged and easily accessible. While learning to code, he doesn't want to have to continually switch from his editor to the web page that contains the material he is learning. (Does this mean a responsive site, or the content is easy to learn?)


Context Scenarios
-----------------

### "Search for specific pattern"

websites that assist him will be kept in an open browser tab so Thomas can quickly find the code for a pattern that appears in his visual design. 

### "Browse pattern library"

### "Viewing a pattern code sample"

Data Requirements
-----------------

Functional Requirements
-----------------------

Interaction Framework
---------------------

### Posture

The web application will behave similarly to a _Sovereign Posture_, in that while the user is comprehending the content, the user interface will command their attention.
