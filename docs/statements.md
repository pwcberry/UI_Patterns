Problem Statement
=================

Many developers who do not have experience coding for the user interface are unaware of design patterns that are in use in software development these days. They produce web pages that do not provide interactive behaviours expected by users, which leads to more time required for fixing problems.

Vision Statement
================

"UI Patterns in Code" will give developers confidence in understanding how design patterns accommodate interactive behaviours and to write code effectively so the application behaves as expected by the user, and as envisioned by the designer.
